# Module 5 Homework

In this homework assignment, I created a simple task board application for managing project task.

To accomplish this, I did the following:

- Followed Bootstrap documentation and created a bootstrap modal inside index.html to create a pop-up form for adding tasks.
- Created global variables, referencing the 3 form inputs inside my bootstrap modal as jquery strings.
- Added an event listener to the submit button.

- Save stringified data to storage & parsed said data to be read on the page.

- Used functions to create new taskcards and appended user data (along with the delete button) to the cardBody inside the taskCard.

- Used a function to create the 3 lists "to-do", "in-progress" & "done" for the taskCards to exist within and made them draggable between.

- Referenced the jquery strings to add values inside the new tasks  (including a randomUUID function to give each new task a unique ID)

- Used a function to delete the task, clearing all  values from SaveProjectsToStorage & displaying the updated task list.
